# Real Life Among Us
## What is this?
Real Life Among Us is a project spearheaded by Igrium (Sam) and FwappyPotato (Ezra) that attempts to re-create the game *Among Us* in real life using technology. The process is being documented on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ1ZGXGdHSw&list=PLjn0XvzCcXIAq8WrNV_nOfz9ObkOmrhmr)

## How do I play?
The codebase is not nearly developed enough for an actual game yet. Subscribe to my YouTube channel for updates!

## How can I help?
If you envision a feature that you wish the codebase had, or you see a mistake in our programming that you think you can fix, feel free to make a pull request. It will likely get accepted.
