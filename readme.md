# Real Life Among Us
## What is this?
Real Life Among Us is a project spearheaded by Igrium (Sam) and FwappyPotato (Ezra) that attempts to re-create the game *Among Us* in real life using technology. The process is being documented on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ1ZGXGdHSw&list=PLjn0XvzCcXIAq8WrNV_nOfz9ObkOmrhmr)

## How do I play?
The codebase is not nearly developed enough for an actual game yet. Subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/thesam54123) for updates!

## How can I help?
If you envision a feature that you wish the codebase had, or you see a mistake in our programming that you think you can fix, feel free to make a pull request. It will likely get accepted. You can also join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kyC8StMjbf) if you want to be more involved.

## Setting up
To set Real Life Among Us up, first make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. After that, clone this repository. Then run `npm i`, `npm ci` and `npm i --include=dev`. After that, you're ready to start developing or running the project!<br>
* **Development:** Run `npm run dev`
* **Production:** _The code isn't ready for production yet!_
